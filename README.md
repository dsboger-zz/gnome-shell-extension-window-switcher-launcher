Launch favorite apps from window switcher popup.

Git repository: https://github.com/dsboger/gnome-shell-extension-window-switcher-launcher

E.g.o: (pending approval)

## Notes

- Window Switcher Launcher was tested with GNOME Shell 3.22+
- It may (and probably will) interfere with other extensions that also modify
the window switcher. This scenario was not tested yet. If you find
an incompatibility that you would like to see fixed, please file a bug report!

## Installation

You may simply go to the e.g.o URL above and install the latest, reviewed release
of Window Switcher Launcher. It is also possible to install from the Git repository by
cloning (or downloading a release snapshot) and running the following commands
from the root folder:


```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make localinstall
```
